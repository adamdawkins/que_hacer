# Functional Core, Imperative Shell
The idea of this is to build up to a more Core/Shell paradigm for a web
application, but I was getting too caught up in web stuff; so going to do the
same with rudimentary puts calls acting as the shell, maybe eventually a CLI
app, and then extend out from there.

## Features
(Modified from TODO MVC)

No todos
[ ] When there are no todos - the only action is to add a todo

Mark all as complete - marks all todos complete

Item
A todo item has three possible interactions:

- complete one todo
- edit one todo
- remove todo
- update todo

Counter
Displays the number of active todos in a pluralized form.

Clear completed button
Removes completed todos when clicked. Should be hidden when there are no completed todos.

Persistence
